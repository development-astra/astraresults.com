                                    Published: February 2026 | Reading Time: ~13 minutes | Category: SEO & Technical
                                </p>
                                <div class="content">
                                    <p>An SEO audit is the foundation of every successful search strategy. Without one,
                                        you are optimizing blind—fixing problems you cannot see while ignoring issues
                                        you do not know exist. Yet most businesses either skip auditing entirely or run
                                        superficial scans that catch surface-level errors while missing the structural
                                        problems that actually suppress rankings.</p>
                                    <p>The data makes the case clearly: <strong>only 33% of websites pass Google’s Core
                                            Web Vitals assessment</strong> (Chrome User Experience Report). Sites that
                                        do pass rank 28% higher on average (Moz). Meanwhile, 75% of mobile sites fail at
                                        least one Core Web Vital metric (Google CrUX), Google rewrites 76% of page
                                        titles in search results when they are poorly written (Search Engine Land,
                                        2025), and only 0.63% of users ever click on page two results (Backlinko). The
                                        margin between visibility and invisibility is razor-thin, and a structured audit
                                        is how you find and fix the issues that keep you on the wrong side of that
                                        margin.</p>
                                    <p>This checklist covers 25 specific audit items organized by priority and impact.
                                        Each item includes what to check, why it matters, the tools to use, and the
                                        benchmark to hit. Run this audit quarterly—or before any major site change—to
                                        maintain a healthy SEO foundation.</p>

                                <h2 class="title">Section 1: Crawlability &amp; Indexing (Items 1–5)</h2>
                                <div class="content">
                                    <p>If search engines cannot crawl and index your pages, nothing else matters. These
                                        five checks ensure Google can actually find and process your content.</p>
                                    <h3>1. Robots.txt Configuration</h3>
                                    <p>Your robots.txt file controls which pages search engine bots can and cannot
                                        access. A single misconfigured line can block your entire site from indexing.
                                        Check that important sections—your blog, service pages, and product pages—are
                                        not accidentally blocked. Use Google Search Console’s robots.txt tester
                                        (Settings → robots.txt) to verify. Also confirm there is no duplicate robots.txt
                                        on subdomains that might conflict with your primary file.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Tool: </strong>Google Search Console | <strong>Benchmark: </strong>No
                                        critical pages blocked; file updated within last 90 days</p>
                                    <h3>2. XML Sitemap Health</h3>
                                    <p>Your XML sitemap tells search engines which pages exist and which ones matter.
                                        Common problems include sitemaps that contain non-indexable URLs, redirect
                                        chains, 404 errors, or low-value pages that waste crawl budget. A clean sitemap
                                        improves crawl prioritization and reduces index waste. Submit your sitemap
                                        through Google Search Console and check the Pages report for indexing issues.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>Tool: </strong>Screaming Frog, Google Search Console | <strong>Benchmark:
                                        </strong>100% of sitemap URLs return 200 status; no noindexed pages included</p>
                                    <h3>3. Indexation Status</h3>
                                    <p>Use Google Search Console’s Pages report to check how many of your pages are
                                        actually indexed versus how many you expect to be indexed. Common issues include
                                        pages excluded by “crawled – currently not indexed,” “discovered – currently not
                                        indexed,” or “duplicate without canonical.” Each exclusion reason requires a
                                        different fix—and ignoring them means content you created is completely
                                        invisible to searchers.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Tool: </strong>Google Search Console (Pages report) | <strong>Benchmark:
                                        </strong>90%+ of target pages successfully indexed</p>
                                    <h3>4. Canonical Tags</h3>
                                    <p>Canonical tags tell search engines which version of a page is the “official” one,
                                        preventing duplicate content issues. Every page on your site should have a
                                        self-referencing canonical tag. Missing canonicals—a problem found on many sites
                                        during audits—risk diluting your ranking signals across duplicate versions of
                                        the same page. This is especially critical for e-commerce sites with filtered or
                                        parameterized URLs.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Tool: </strong>Screaming Frog, Ahrefs Site Audit | <strong>Benchmark:
                                        </strong>100% of indexable pages have correct canonical tags</p>
                                    <h3>5. Internal Link Architecture</h3>
                                    <p>Internal linking is no longer just about passing PageRank—it is about helping
                                        search engines understand your topical structure and entity relationships.
                                        Important pages should be reachable within three clicks of the homepage. Check
                                        for orphan pages (pages with no internal links pointing to them), broken
                                        internal links, and opportunities to strengthen topical clusters by linking
                                        related content together. Add breadcrumb structured data (BreadcrumbList schema)
                                        for maximum benefit.</p>

                                                In many audits, cleaning up sitemaps and fixing indexation issues
                                                delivers the fastest ranking improvements. If Google is not indexing
                                                your
                                                content, no amount of on-page optimization will help

                                    <p>LCP measures how quickly the largest visible content element loads. Google’s
                                        threshold is <strong>under 2.5 seconds</strong>. Pages with slow LCP have a 25%
                                        lower chance of appearing in the top 10 search results (Google Marketing
                                        Platform). Common culprits include unoptimized hero images, render-blocking CSS
                                        and JavaScript, slow server response times, and uncompressed resources. An
                                        improvement of just 0.2 seconds in LCP can lead to a 15% increase in conversion

                                        interactivity. Unlike FID, which only measured the first interaction, INP
                                        measures the worst interaction delay throughout a user’s entire session. The

                                    <p>CLS measures visual stability—how much the page layout shifts unexpectedly as it
                                        loads. The threshold is <strong>under 0.1</strong>. Layout shifts typically
                                        occur when images lack width/height attributes, ads load dynamically, or web
                                        fonts cause text to reflow. Reducing CLS improves dwell time by 10%, boosting
                                        ranking signals (Web.dev). Always specify image dimensions in HTML and use
                                        font-display: swap for custom fonts.</p>

                                    <p>HTTPS is standard—88% of websites use it (W3Techs)—and sites with HTTPS
                                        encryption have a 5% ranking advantage (SSL Score). Beyond the certificate
                                        itself, check for security headers: X-Frame-Options, HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport
                                        Security), Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, and Referrer-Policy.
                                        Missing security headers are a common audit finding that is easy to fix and

                                    <p>Google rewrites <strong>76% of page titles</strong> in search results as of 2025
                                        (Search Engine Land)—up from 61% in 2023. This means poorly written or
                                        misaligned titles are being replaced more frequently than ever. Each page should
                                        have a unique, keyword-rich title under 60 characters (approximately 580 pixels)
                                        that accurately describes the page content. Avoid duplicate titles across pages,
                                        which dilute your ranking signals.</p>

                                    <p>While meta descriptions are not a direct ranking factor, they significantly
                                        influence click-through rates—which is an indirect ranking signal. Write
                                        compelling, action-oriented descriptions under 155 characters for each page.
                                        Include your primary keyword naturally, and treat each description as an ad for
                                        the page. Pages without meta descriptions rely on Google’s auto-generated
                                        snippets, which rarely represent your content as well as a crafted description.

                                    <p>Every page should have exactly one H1 tag that contains the primary keyword and
                                        clearly describes the page’s topic. Multiple H1 tags—a common issue found on
                                        many service pages during audits—dilute the primary heading signal. Use H2 and
                                        H3 tags to create a logical content hierarchy that helps both users and search
                                        engines understand the structure of your content. Consider using question-based
                                        H2/H3 headings that mirror how people search, as these are more likely to be

                                    <p>Images are often the largest contributors to slow page loads and poor LCP scores.
                                        Check that all images use modern formats (WebP or AVIF), are properly
                                        compressed, have descriptive alt text containing relevant keywords, and include
                                        explicit width and height attributes to prevent layout shifts. Implement lazy
                                        loading for images below the fold, but ensure that your hero/LCP image loads
                                        eagerly. Also verify that no images return 404 errors—broken image paths are a
                                        common finding in site audits.</p>

                                    <p>URLs should be short, descriptive, and readable. Use hyphens to separate words,
                                        include the primary keyword, and avoid parameters, session IDs, or deeply nested
                                        paths. A clean URL structure helps both users and search engines understand what
                                        a page contains before clicking. Avoid changing URLs without implementing proper
                                        301 redirects, and regularly check for redirect chains (A→B→C should be

                                        competitive queries after the December 2025 update. Anonymous or generic content
                                        authorship now faces significant ranking challenges. Every piece of content
                                        should have a named author with a bio that establishes their expertise, links to
                                        their professional profiles, and demonstrates first-hand experience with the
                                        topic. Add AuthorPage schema and link to author profiles from each article.</p>

                                        content for accuracy, updating statistics, verifying links, and adding new
                                        information where relevant. Add “last updated” dates to all content pages and
                                        implement a quarterly content review schedule. Search engines reward content
                                        that demonstrates ongoing maintenance and accuracy.</p>

                                        versions, or www vs. non-www variations—confuses search engines and splits
                                        ranking signals. Use canonical tags to designate the preferred version of each
                                        page, implement 301 redirects for any duplicate URLs, and check that your CMS is
                                        not generating duplicate pages automatically. Over 67% of domains implementing
                                        hreflang tags have configuration issues (Ahrefs), so international sites need
                                        special attention.</p>

                                    <p>Not all backlinks are equal. Links from high-authority, topically relevant sites
                                        carry significantly more weight than links from low-quality or irrelevant
                                        domains. Audit your backlink profile for toxic links—links from spammy,
                                        penalized, or completely unrelated sites that could trigger a manual action or
                                        algorithmic penalty. Check your referring domain diversity: a healthy profile
                                        has links from many different domains rather than many links from a few domains.

                                        restructured, those links return 404 errors and their SEO value is lost.
                                        Identify all external links pointing to 404 pages on your site and implement 301
                                        redirects to the most relevant current page. This recovers link equity you have
                                        already earned without requiring any new outreach.</p>

                                    <p>Identify which sites link to your competitors but not to you. These represent
                                        realistic link acquisition opportunities because the linking site has already
                                        demonstrated willingness to link to content in your niche. Prioritize sites that
                                        link to multiple competitors, as these are the most likely to be receptive to
                                        your content as well. SEO leads close at 14.6% compared to 1.7% for outbound
                                        leads (Doyen Digital), which demonstrates the value of investing in organic

                                    <p>AI Overviews and featured snippets pull content from pages that provide clear,
                                        well-structured answers to specific questions. To optimize for these surfaces:
                                        add question-based H2/H3 headings that mirror how people search, write concise
                                        40–60 word answer blocks immediately below each heading, use lists and tables
                                        for comparison content, and ensure your content is factually accurate with
                                        citations to credible sources. Clear, scannable structure makes it easier for
                                        both traditional featured snippets and AI Overviews to extract and surface your

                                        25-point checklist, prioritize your findings by impact and effort: fix
                                        crawlability and indexation issues first (they block everything else), address
                                        Core Web Vitals next (they affect every page simultaneously), then work through
                                        on-page optimization, content quality, backlinks, and AI visibility in order.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The top three results in Google receive 54.4% of all clicks (Backlinko), and the
                                        difference between ranking on page one and page two is the difference between
                                        visibility and obscurity—only 0.63% of users ever click on page two. <strong>A
                                            structured, recurring audit is how you systematically close the gap between
                                            where your site is and where it needs to be.</strong> Run this checklist
                                        quarterly, track improvements over time, and treat SEO health the same way you
                                        treat financial health: regular check-ups prevent small problems from becoming
                                        costly emergencies.</p>
