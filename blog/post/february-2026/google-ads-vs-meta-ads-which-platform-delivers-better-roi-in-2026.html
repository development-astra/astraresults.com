                                    <p><i>The Google Ads vs Meta Ads debate represents digital advertising's most
                                            critical budget allocation decision. Based on 2026 industry data, Meta Ads
                                            average 6:1 ROAS across industries while Google Ads deliver 4:1 ROAS—but
                                            these numbers mask crucial nuance. E-commerce brands achieve 7.5:1 ROAS on
                                            Meta versus 6:1 on Google, while B2B services see the inverse: 5:1 on Google
                                            versus 3.5:1 on Meta. This comprehensive analysis examines conversion rates,
                                            cost structures, targeting capabilities, and strategic implementation to
                                            help you determine which platform—or which combination—maximizes ROI for
                                            your specific business model.</i></p>
                                    <p>The question 'Which platform delivers better ROI?' has no universal answer
                                        because these platforms serve fundamentally different marketing functions.
                                        According to Lemonade Digital's analysis, Google Ads captures demand while Meta
                                        Ads creates demand—users on Google are actively searching with high purchase
                                        intent, while users on Meta are browsing and discovering (Lemonade Digital,
                                        2026). This psychological difference drives every subsequent performance metric.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>According to Statista, Google and Meta together capture over 60% of US ad spend,
                                        making them the duopoly of digital advertising (Digiting Solutions, 2025).
                                        Understanding when each platform delivers superior ROI requires examining your
                                        business through multiple lenses: industry vertical, customer journey stage,
                                        product complexity, purchase cycle length, and target audience behavior.</p>
                                    <p>This guide provides data-driven analysis of both platforms' 2026 performance,
                                        helping you allocate budgets strategically rather than splitting them
                                        arbitrarily. Whether you're a Miami e-commerce brand, B2B service provider, or
                                        local business, you'll learn exactly which platform—or which strategic
                                        combination—delivers optimal ROI for your specific objectives.</p>

                                <h2 class="title">Understanding the Core Difference: Intent vs. Discovery</h2>
                                <div class="content">
                                    <p>Before comparing metrics, understanding the fundamental psychological difference
                                        between platforms is essential. According to Spinta Digital's 2026 analysis,
                                        Google's primary strength is capturing active search intent—people looking for
                                        something right now—while Meta prioritizes interest-based social discovery
                                        (Spinta Digital, 2026).</p>
                                    <h3>How Google Ads Works: Demand Capture</h3>
                                    <p>Google Ads operates on a pay-per-click model where ads appear based on user
                                        search queries, capturing high purchase intent (Abedin Tech, 2025). When someone
                                        types keywords like 'buy running shoes' or 'emergency plumber Miami,' your ad
                                        appears at the moment of need. According to Lemonade Digital, this intent-driven
                                        approach works best when people are actively looking (Lemonade Digital, 2026).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Google's ecosystem spans Search Network, Display Network, YouTube, Shopping, and
                                        Performance Max campaigns that automate placement across all Google properties
                                        (Xapads, 2026). When Americans need something urgently—an attorney, dentist,
                                        loan, plumber, or product—they search for it, which is where Google dominates
                                        the conversion landscape (Digiting Solutions, 2025).</p>
                                    <h3>How Meta Ads Works: Demand Generation</h3>
                                    <p>Meta Ads uses algorithms to display content on Facebook and Instagram feeds based
                                        on user interests, demographics, and behaviors (Abedin Tech, 2025). Unlike
                                        search ads, it interrupts scrolling with visually appealing formats, building
                                        awareness and nurturing leads. According to Abedin Tech, this proactive approach
                                        targets potential customers before they search, fostering engagement through
                                        likes, shares, and comments (Abedin Tech, 2025).</p>
                                    <p>Meta platforms offer massive reach: access to 2.9 billion users across Facebook,
                                        Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, enabling precise targeting for broad or
                                        niche audiences (Abedin Tech, 2025). According to Lemonade Digital, Meta Ads
                                        works best when people are browsing rather than searching (Lemonade Digital,
                                        2026).</p>
                                    <p>This intent versus discovery split is why top brands don't choose one over the
                                        other—they combine both strategically (Digiting Solutions, 2025). As Hazen Tech
                                        summarizes: Meta Ads are like digital billboards that make people want you,
                                        while Google Ads are like digital salespeople that make people find you (Hazen
                                        Tech, 2025).</p>

                                <h2 class="title">ROAS and ROI Comparison: The Numbers That Matter</h2>
                                <div class="content">
                                    <p>Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) measures revenue generated per dollar spent. According
                                        to 2026 industry data compiled by Dancing Chicken, clicks and impressions
                                        matter, but the real game in 2025-2026 is ROAS, with brands achieving highest
                                        returns by treating PPC holistically (Dancing Chicken, 2026).</p>
                                    <h3>Overall Platform Averages</h3>
                                    <p>Data from 2025 highlights that Meta Ads average a 6:1 ROAS, while Google Ads
                                        average 4:1 ROAS (Dancing Chicken, 2026). However, performance varies
                                        significantly by industry, making these averages misleading for specific
                                        business types.</p>
                                    <p>In terms of overall ROI, businesses typically see an average ROI of 200% on
                                        Google Ads, meaning $2 in revenue for every $1 spent (Classify Skill, 2026).
                                        This varies dramatically by industry—e-commerce businesses often achieve
                                        300-400% ROI, while service-based businesses average 150-250% (Classify Skill,
                                        2026).</p>
                                    <p>Meta Ads deliver an average ROI of approximately 150-250% across industries in
                                        2026 (Classify Skill, 2026). E-commerce brands using dynamic product ads often
                                        see higher returns (250-350%), while lead generation campaigns typically range
                                        from 100-200% ROI (Classify Skill, 2026).</p>
                                    <h3>Industry-Specific ROAS Breakdown</h3>
                                    <p>E-Commerce:</p>
                                    <p>Meta Ads lead with a ROAS of 7.5:1, compared to Google Ads' 6:1 (Dancing Chicken,
                                        2026). E-commerce businesses benefit from both platforms, with Google Shopping
                                        ads capturing high-intent searchers ready to buy, while Meta's dynamic product
                                        ads excel at retargeting and introducing products to interested audiences
                                        (Classify Skill, 2026). The most successful e-commerce brands use both platforms
                                        synergistically, allocating 60% to Google and 40% to Meta (Classify Skill,

                                        (Dancing Chicken, 2026). B2B campaigns lean more heavily on Google with a 70-30

                                        from Google Ads (Classify Skill, 2026). When someone's pipe bursts, they search

                                    <p>Conversion rates reveal the quality of traffic each platform delivers. According
                                        to Abedin Tech's 2025 data, users searching with high intent convert more
                                        readily than users discovering products while browsing (Abedin Tech, 2025).</p>
                                    <p>Google Ads conversion rates average 7.52% in 2025, far surpassing display ads
                                        (Abedin Tech, 2025). Users searching 'buy running shoes online' are ready to
                                        act, which is why searches convert at rates unmatched by any social platform
                                        (Digiting Solutions, 2025). According to JKS Digital, conversion rates are
                                        higher on Google Ads because users are already searching for something specific
                                        (JKS Digital, 2025).</p>
                                    <p>Meta Ads achieve conversion rates of 9.21% according to Dancing Chicken's
                                        analysis (Dancing Chicken, 2026). While JKS Digital notes Meta Ads may have
                                        slightly lower conversion rates than Google in some contexts, they excel in
                                        brand awareness and audience loyalty (JKS Digital, 2026).</p>
                                    <p>The apparent contradiction—Meta showing 9.21% conversions versus 'slightly lower'
                                        in other analyses—reflects measurement differences. Meta's figure includes
                                        on-platform engagement conversions (likes, shares, sign-ups), while comparison
                                        metrics focus on direct sales conversions where Google's intent-driven traffic
                                        performs stronger.</p>

                                    <h3>Google Ads Costs</h3>
                                    <p>Google operates on competitive auction-based bidding where multiple advertisers
                                        compete for the same search queries and placements (Xapads, 2026). Industry
                                        benchmarks for 2025-2026 show average Search CPC ranging from $2.69 to $5.26
                                        across industries (Xapads/Click Forest, 2026).</p>
                                    <p>The auction system means costs fluctuate based on competition
                                        intensity—high-value keywords in competitive industries can exceed $10 per click
                                        (Xapads, 2026). However, according to Dancing Chicken, ads with a Quality Score
                                        of 9-10 can cost up to 50% less per click compared to those scoring 5 (Dancing
                                        Chicken, 2026).</p>
                                    <p>Furthermore, costs have risen: Google Ads now costs an average of $5.26 per click
                                        (Click Forest, 2026). However, higher costs do not automatically mean poorer
                                        results—on the contrary, 65% of all sectors saw better conversion rates in 2025
                                        (Click Forest, 2026).</p>
                                    <h3>Meta Ads Costs</h3>
                                    <p>Meta also uses auction-based pricing but generally delivers lower costs due to
                                        its discovery-based model (Xapads, 2026). Meta Ads offer cost-effective reach
                                        with lower CPCs averaging $0.70 to $1.72, making them ideal for A/B testing and
                                        small budgets with strong ROI in awareness campaigns (Abedin Tech/Click Forest,
                                        2025/2026).</p>
                                    <p>Meta's entire pricing logic revolves around impression-based bidding (CPM)—you
                                        pay for visibility and not necessarily for clicks or conversions (Hazen Tech,
                                        2025). Meta's costs increased modestly in Q4 2025 during the competitive holiday
                                        season but have shown relative stability compared to Google (Xapads, 2026).</p>
                                    <p>According to Spinta Digital's analysis, Google equals higher cost per click but
                                        higher conversion rate, while Meta equals cheaper reach but needs nurturing
                                        before conversion (Spinta Digital, 2026). For every $1,000 spent, Google wins in
                                        intent ROI while Meta wins in awareness ROI (Spinta Digital, 2026).</p>

                                    <p>Both platforms offer sophisticated targeting, but their approaches differ
                                        fundamentally. According to Spinta Digital, Google's targeting equals accuracy
                                        while Meta's targeting equals expansion—if you're scaling reach, Meta wins, but
                                        if you're capturing demand, Google dominates (Spinta Digital, 2026).</p>
                                    <h3>Google Ads Targeting</h3>
                                    <p>Google Ads works by matching ads to keywords, content, or audiences (Lemonade
                                        Digital, 2026). A search ad appears when someone types a query into Google, with
                                        ads also appearing across YouTube or the Google Display Network depending on
                                        campaign setup (Lemonade Digital, 2026).</p>
                                    <p>Google is actively competing with demand-generation platforms through the
                                        expansion of Performance Max campaigns, which allow advertisers to run a single,
                                        goal-based campaign across all of Google's inventory—Search, YouTube, Display,
                                        Discover, and Shopping—using automation and machine learning to determine where
                                        and when ads appear (Lemonade Digital, 2026).</p>
                                    <h3>Meta Ads Targeting</h3>
                                    <p>Meta's data collection across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger
                                        creates detailed user profiles (Classify Skill, 2026). Advertisers can target
                                        based on demographics, interests, behaviors, life events, and custom audiences
                                        with remarkable precision (Classify Skill, 2026).</p>
                                    <p>According to Abedin Tech, Meta offers advanced retargeting through Pixel
                                        tracking, which allows personalized ads to website visitors and improves
                                        conversion rates by 70% (Abedin Tech, 2025). AI optimization tools like
                                        Advantage+ automate targeting, enhancing performance and efficiency (Abedin
                                        Tech, 2025).</p>
                                    <p>Meta's automation thrives on pattern recognition and studies engagement behavior,
                                        learning what type of content, copy, and audience combination improves
                                        conversions—the more data you feed it, the more precise it gets (Hazen Tech,
                                        2025). However, Meta scaling requires patience as pushing budgets too fast
                                        resets the learning phase (Hazen Tech, 2025).</p>

                                    <p>Meta platforms, especially Instagram, are heavily mobile-focused, with over 98%
                                        of users accessing via mobile (Dancing Chicken, 2026). This focus translates
                                        into better results—Meta's mobile-optimized campaigns see 27% higher
                                        click-through rates than desktop campaigns (Dancing Chicken, 2026).</p>

                                        2026). When selling complex solutions with long sales cycles, capturing active
                                        research intent through search delivers better-qualified leads than

                                    <h3>1. Visual Product Categories</h3>
                                    <p>Fashion, food, travel, and lifestyle businesses thrive on Meta's inherently
                                        visual platforms (Classify Skill, 2026). Instagram Reels and Stories ads have
                                        shown exceptional engagement rates in 2026 (Classify Skill, 2026). A fashion
                                        brand will excel on Meta Ads due to visual discovery (Spinta Digital, 2026).</p>
                                    <h3>2. Brand Awareness and Top-of-Funnel</h3>
                                    <p>According to Spinta Digital's framework, TOFU (Top of Funnel) goals for awareness
                                        and audience building should use Meta Ads with Reels, carousels, and influencer
                                        UGC (User Generated Content), measuring CTR and engagement rate (Spinta Digital,
                                        2026).</p>
                                    <h3>3. Retargeting and Nurture Campaigns</h3>
                                    <p>Meta's Pixel tracking allows personalized ads to website visitors, improving
                                        conversion rates by 70% (Abedin Tech, 2025). Meta Ads builds awareness and
                                        supports remarketing, which can later improve Google Ads performance through
                                        increased branded search—the Halo effect (Lemonade Digital, 2026).</p>
                                    <h3>4. Limited Budgets Requiring Maximum Reach</h3>
                                    <p>Meta Ads generally have lower minimum budgets and CPCs compared to Google
                                        (Classify Skill, 2026). With CPCs averaging $0.70-$1.72 versus Google's
                                        $2.69-$5.26, Meta provides cost-effective reach ideal for small budgets (Abedin
                                        Tech/Click Forest, 2025/2026). According to Click Forest, $500/month is
                                        sufficient for statistically significant testing on Meta versus $1,000/month
                                        needed for effective Google Shopping campaigns (Click Forest, 2026).</p>

                                <div class="content">
                                    <p>The smartest advertisers in 2026 don't pick sides—they integrate both platforms
                                        into one funnel ecosystem (Spinta Digital, 2026). According to Spinta Digital, a
                                        hybrid funnel typically delivers 2.5x higher ROI than single-platform campaigns
                                        because it combines attention (Meta) with intent (Google) (Spinta Digital,
                                        2026).</p>
                                    <h3>Full-Funnel Integration Strategy</h3>
                                    <p>According to Hazen Tech's strategic framework, the smartest marketers use both
                                        platforms—they build awareness and nurture interest on Meta, then capture that
                                        intent and close the loop on Google (Hazen Tech, 2025). That's how conversion
                                        magic happens, when campaigns complement each other instead of competing (Hazen
                                        Tech, 2025).</p>
                                    <p>Stage 1 - Awareness (Meta Ads):</p>
                                    <p>Run Meta Ads to create interest using Reels, carousels, and influencer content.
                                        Measure CTR and engagement rate (Spinta Digital, 2026).</p>
                                    <p>Stage 2 - Consideration (Meta Ads):</p>
                                    <p>Nurture interest with testimonials, comparison videos, and social proof. Measure
                                        click-to-lead rate (Spinta Digital, 2026).</p>
                                    <p>Stage 3 - Conversion (Google Ads):</p>
                                    <p>Capture high intent and drive sales through Search, Shopping, and YouTube
                                        remarketing. Measure conversion rate and ROAS (Spinta Digital, 2026).</p>
                                    <p>As Spinta Digital summarizes: Meta warms the lead, Google closes the sale, and
                                        together they scale profitably (Spinta Digital, 2026).</p>
                                    <h3>Budget Allocation Frameworks</h3>
                                    <p>E-commerce businesses often allocate 55% of their budget to Google and 45% to
                                        Meta, while B2B campaigns lean more heavily on Google with a 70-30 split
                                        (Dancing Chicken, 2026). Travel brands invest about 60% in Meta Ads to take
                                        advantage of visual storytelling features (Dancing Chicken, 2026).</p>
                                    <p>The most successful e-commerce brands use both platforms synergistically,
                                        allocating 60% to Google and 40% to Meta (Classify Skill, 2026). Both platforms
                                        use Google Shopping/Search to capture ready-to-buy shoppers and Meta for
                                        discovery, dynamic retargeting, and visual product storytelling—combining them
                                        typically yields the strongest ROI for e-commerce (Abedin Tech, 2025).</p>
                                    <h3>Measurement and Attribution</h3>
                                    <p>Track conversions, revenue, and ad spend per platform. Calculate ROAS = Revenue ÷
                                        Ad Spend and CPA = Ad Spend ÷ Conversions (Abedin Tech, 2025). According to
                                        Hazen Tech, if you're optimizing for attention and engagement, Meta's
                                        in-platform analytics work beautifully, but if your goal is performance, ROI,
                                        and cross-channel insight, Google's reporting stack is simply on another level
                                        (Hazen Tech, 2025).</p>

                                    <p>Once you've allocated budgets, platform-specific optimization ensures maximum ROI

                                    <h3>Google Ads Optimization</h3>
                                    <p>Improving Quality Score is a smart way to lower ad costs and improve ad
                                        placement—ads with a Quality Score of 9-10 can cost up to 50% less per click
                                        compared to those scoring 5 (Dancing Chicken, 2026).</p>
                                    <p>Create tightly themed ad groups: Group ads around specific, relevant keywords,
                                        and include negative keywords to minimize wasted spend (Dancing Chicken, 2026).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Test new headlines and descriptions monthly to continuously improve performance
                                        (Click Forest, 2026).</p>
                                    <p>According to Hazen Tech, Google's automation uses adaptive optimization—over
                                        time, Google identifies which signal combinations produce the best ROI and
                                        adjusts bids accordingly (Hazen Tech, 2025). In simple terms, Meta's learning
                                        feels like intuition refined by repetition, while Google's feels like logic
                                        refined by math (Hazen Tech, 2025).</p>
                                    <h3>Meta Ads Optimization</h3>
                                    <p>Refresh visual creatives every 2-3 weeks to prevent ad fatigue (Click Forest,
                                        2026).</p>
                                    <p>Meta Ads often rely on Advantage+ campaigns, CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization),
                                        and Dynamic Creative Testing (Hazen Tech, 2025).</p>
                                    <p>According to Hazen Tech, when you plan cross-platform campaigns, you should
                                        always let Meta handle discovery first and Google fine-tune conversions later
                                        (Hazen Tech, 2025).</p>
                                    <p>Meta charges advertisers for impressions while Google charges for clicks—Meta
                                        rewards creative testing and broad optimization, while Google prizes
                                        intent-driven precision (Hazen Tech, 2025).</p>

                                    <h3>Miami E-Commerce and Retail</h3>
                                    <p>With Miami's strong tourism and fashion sectors, e-commerce brands should
                                        leverage Meta's 7.5:1 ROAS advantage (Dancing Chicken, 2026) for product
                                        discovery while using Google Shopping for high-intent purchase searches.
                                        Allocate 55% Google, 45% Meta (Dancing Chicken, 2026).</p>

                                    <p>Law firms, accounting firms, medical practices, and consulting services should
                                        prioritize Google Ads with 70-30 budget allocation (Dancing Chicken, 2026).
                                        Miami's competitive professional services market rewards high-intent search

                                    <p>Hotels, restaurants, and attractions benefit from Meta's visual storytelling—60%
                                        Meta, 40% Google allocation (Dancing Chicken, 2026). Use Meta for destination

                                    <p>Real estate requires both platforms: Meta for property showcases and neighborhood

                                <h2 class="title">Frequently Asked Questions About Google Ads vs Meta Ads</h2>
                                <div class="content">
                                    <h3>Which platform is cheaper to advertise on?</h3>
                                    <p>Meta Ads have lower CPCs averaging $0.70-$1.72 compared to Google's $2.69-$5.26
                                        (Abedin Tech/Click Forest, 2025/2026). However, 'cheaper' doesn't mean 'better
                                        ROI'—Google's higher-intent traffic often converts at higher rates despite
                                        higher costs. According to Click Forest, higher costs do not automatically mean
                                        poorer results, as 65% of all sectors saw better conversion rates in 2025 on
                                        Google (Click Forest, 2026). The question isn't which costs less per click, but
                                        which delivers better revenue per dollar spent.</p>
                                    <h3>Can I run both platforms with a small budget?</h3>
                                    <p>Yes, but prioritize strategically. According to Click Forest, minimum effective
                                        budgets are: Google Ads requires $1,000/month for effective Shopping campaigns,
                                        while Meta Ads needs $500/month for statistically significant testing (Click
                                        Forest, 2026). With limited budgets under $1,500/month total, start with the
                                        platform that matches your primary objective—Meta for awareness, Google for
                                        conversions. According to Abedin Tech, $10/day is an acceptable starting budget
                                        for testing creative and audience assumptions on Meta (Abedin Tech, 2025).</p>
                                    <h3>How long does it take to see ROI on each platform?</h3>
                                    <p>Google Ads can generate conversions within days for high-intent searches, though
                                        optimization typically requires 30-90 days of data collection. Meta Ads requires
                                        longer nurturing—expect 60-120 days to see meaningful ROI as campaigns build
                                        awareness and move prospects through the funnel. The timeframe depends heavily
                                        on purchase cycle length and product complexity. According to Lemonade Digital,
                                        Meta Ads may deliver lower cost per click, but ROI often takes longer to
                                        realize, as Meta builds awareness and supports remarketing (Lemonade Digital,
                                        2026).</p>
                                    <h3>What conversion tracking do I need for each platform?</h3>
                                    <p>Google Ads requires Google Ads conversion tracking or Google Analytics 4
                                        integration with proper conversion event setup. Meta Ads requires Meta Pixel
                                        installation on your website—according to Abedin Tech, Pixel tracking allows
                                        personalized ads to website visitors, improving conversion rates by 70% (Abedin
                                        Tech, 2025). Both platforms benefit from server-side tracking for improved
                                        accuracy post-iOS 14+ privacy changes. Without proper tracking, you're flying
                                        blind regardless of which platform you choose.</p>
                                    <h3>Should I pause one platform if the other is performing better?</h3>
                                    <p>No. According to Lemonade Digital, Meta Ads builds awareness and supports
                                        remarketing, which can later improve Google Ads performance through increased
                                        branded search—the Halo effect (Lemonade Digital, 2026). Spinta Digital
                                        reinforces this: Meta warms the lead, Google closes the sale, and together they
                                        scale profitably (Spinta Digital, 2026). Pausing Meta may reduce Google's
                                        branded search volume and increase acquisition costs. The platforms are
                                        complementary, not competitive.</p>
                                    <h3>Which platform is better for local businesses in Miami?</h3>
                                    <p>Google Ads dominates for local services through Local Service Ads and Google Maps
                                        integration (Classify Skill, 2026). When someone's air conditioner breaks in
                                        Miami's summer heat, they search 'emergency AC repair Miami'—they're not
                                        scrolling Instagram. However, local restaurants, salons, and boutiques benefit
                                        from Meta's visual storytelling and local awareness campaigns. For most Miami
                                        local businesses, prioritize Google with 70-80% of budget, using Meta for
                                        community engagement and brand building.</p>

                                <h2 class="title">Conclusion: Strategy Over Platform Preference</h2>
                                <div class="content">
                                    <p>The Google Ads vs Meta Ads debate has no universal winner because these platforms
                                        serve fundamentally different marketing functions. According to 2026 industry
                                        data, Meta Ads average 6:1 ROAS while Google Ads average 4:1 ROAS (Dancing
                                        Chicken, 2026)—but this top-line comparison obscures critical industry-specific
                                        performance differences.</p>
                                    <p>E-commerce brands achieve 7.5:1 ROAS on Meta versus 6:1 on Google, favoring Meta
                                        for product discovery (Dancing Chicken, 2026). B2B services see the inverse: 5:1
                                        on Google versus 3.5:1 on Meta, favoring Google's intent-driven approach
                                        (Dancing Chicken, 2026). Local service businesses overwhelmingly benefit from
                                        Google's moment-of-need capture (Classify Skill, 2026).</p>
                                    <p>As JKS Digital concludes, in 2026 ROI will no longer be measured solely by clicks
                                        and impressions—emphasis will shift toward lifetime customer value, engagement
                                        depth, and brand trust (JKS Digital, 2025). The year 2026 is a milestone year
                                        for digital advertising, and the comparison shows that both platforms are
                                        powerful; the difference lies in approach and objective (JKS Digital, 2025).</p>
                                    <p>The winning strategy integrates both platforms into a full-funnel system.
                                        According to Spinta Digital, hybrid funnels typically deliver 2.5x higher ROI
                                        than single-platform campaigns because they combine attention (Meta) with intent
                                        (Google) (Spinta Digital, 2026). Use Meta for awareness and consideration, then
                                        capture that warmed intent through Google Search and Shopping campaigns.</p>
                                    <p>For Miami businesses specifically, understanding your customer journey determines
                                        platform allocation. Tourism and hospitality businesses leverage Meta's visual
                                        storytelling (60% Meta, 40% Google), professional services prioritize Google's
                                        intent capture (70% Google, 30% Meta), and e-commerce splits strategically
                                        (55-60% Google, 40-45% Meta) (Dancing Chicken, 2026).</p>
