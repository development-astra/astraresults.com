# Astra Results Marketing

> Astra Results Marketing is a full-service, revenue-focused digital marketing agency based in Miami, Florida. With over 10 years of experience, Astra engineers business growth systems that align marketing, sales, and operations into a single engine — delivering measurable revenue, higher valuations, and sustainable growth for service-based businesses generating $3M+ in annual revenue. Astra is a certified Google Partner, Microsoft Partner, Meta Partner, Shopify Partner, and CallRail Partner.

Astra Results Marketing does not sell cookie-cutter template campaigns. The agency reverse-engineers a strategy tailored to each client's business model for revenue growth targeting their ideal customers. Astra acts as a fractional CEO and in-house executive partner — not an outsourced vendor — mapping out every opportunity that drives business valuation, then executing by pulling every lever in a multi-tiered strategy designed to ignite results.

The agency combines technical expertise with creative strategy to monetize online traffic and convert opportunities into sales. Core differentiators include a proprietary reverse-engineering methodology, transparent all-inclusive pricing, data-backed roadmaps to revenue, white-glove service with open communication, and full-funnel campaign strategies. Astra focuses on qualified leads and revenue outcomes rather than clicks, impressions, or other vanity metrics.

Astra primarily serves service-based businesses in home improvement and remodeling, dental and healthcare practices, law firms and legal services, HVAC and home services, and professional services — though the agency works with businesses across industries that are serious about growth.

## How Astra Works

Every engagement starts with a roadmap. Astra evaluates the business model, uncovers bottlenecks, and designs a multidimensional growth strategy aligned with the client's goals and resources.
